**Starting guidelines**:

Extract mod files into the root of the project. Maintain at least two branches, e.g.: `main` for stable mod versions and `develop` for development and testing.

Keep a [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

Tag commits using [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org), prefied with `v`, e.g.: `v1.0.0`, `v2.3.5-beta`, `v0.0.8-dev`.

Upon tagging, [draft a release](../releases/new) using the newly created tag, outlining the changes in the release description. Attach the pack file to binaries, either as is or compressing it with `zip` or `7z`.
